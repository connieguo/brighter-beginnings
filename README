== Brighter Beginnings == 

This application is designed specifically for the non-profit organization, Brighter Beginnings, 
in order to better facilitate their annual wintertime Adopt-A-Family program.  

The purpose of this application is so that donors will be able to search through a list of families
filtering by size of family. The application is meant to remove Brighter Beginnings from their 
traditional way of using paper to match up donors and families, and the Adopt-A-Family program will 
be able to expand to a year-round program. 

== Permissions ==
Case managers will be able to add families, add family members, and set their location.  Managers 
will approve all donors, add or delete case manager accounts, delete donor accounts and have all 
permissions of a case manager.  The superuser will have full permissions to the application, including 
adding and deleting manager accounts.
